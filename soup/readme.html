<h2>HOW DOES THIS WORK?</h2>
<p>Welcome to PancakeDragoness's Soup Message Generator!
To construct a message, you'll need to choose each of its parts. A basic message has two parts, the <span class="emph">template</span> and the <span class="emph">fill phrase.</span><br><br>

An example template looks like this: <span class="emph">"****!"</span><br><br>

While an example fill phrase is a word like <span class="emph">"soup"</span> or <span class="emph">"computer".</span><br><br>

Because there are many fill phrases to choose from, they are further organized into <span class="emph">categories.</span> 
To access them, simply choose the category you want from the category dropdown and a new dropdown will
appear with the fill phrases from that category. For example, <span class="emph">"soup"</span> and <span class="emph">"computer"</span> are both in <span class="emph">"Things".</span><br>
</p>

<h2>COPYING YOUR MESSAGE</h2>

<p>Copying your message to the clipboard for using elsewhere is super simple. Just click the <span class="emph">copy to clipboard button,</span> 
    and it'll be copied automatically for you to paste wherever you like! Please use soup messages responsibly!
</p>

<h2>ADVANCED MODES</h2>

<p>There are more advanced templates to choose from, too! Activating <span class="emph">complex mode</span> by checking its box will give you three new dropdowns to use: <br><br>

Two are a new pair of <span class="emph">template</span> & <span class="emph">fill phrase</span> dropdowns, allowing you to construct a second message just like the first. <br><br>

But to finalize your complex message, you'll also need to choose a <span class="emph">conjunction</span> from the center dropdown. This phrase joins the two messages you've made to create one big message!<br><br>

An example conjunction is a word like <span class="emph">"and"</span> or <span class="emph">"but".</span>
</p>

<h2>TWO-PHRASE TEMPLATE MODE</h2>

<p>There's also <span class="emph">two-phrase template mode!</span> In this mode, there are no conjunctions, but you can still choose two different fill phrases. You get a whole new set of templates to work with
that combine the two phrases you choose in non-standard ways.<br><br>

An example two-phrase template looks like this: <span class="emph">"This **** is ****, isn't it?"</span><br><br>

Please enjoy these advanced modes! I look forward to seeing what messages you can create using this tool!
